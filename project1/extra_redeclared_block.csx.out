CSX program parsed correctly.
Here is its unparsing:
1:	 {
2:	   int a;
3:	   a = 0;
4:	   if ((a != 0))
4:	      {
5:	         int b;
6:	         int c;
7:	         int b;
8:	         c = 10;
9:	         b = 100;
4:	      }
1:	 } EOF


Here is an analysis of identifier declarations and uses for tests/extra_redeclared_block.csx:
2:	a(int): 3,4
5:	b(int): 9
6:	c(int): 8
7:	b(illegal redeclaration)
