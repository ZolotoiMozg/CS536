CSX program parsed correctly.
Here is its unparsing:
1:	 {
2:	   int x;
3:	   int y;
4:	   bool u;
5:	   bool v;
6:	   x = 10;
7:	   y = 20;
8:	   x = (10 + x);
9:	   y = (x - 29898);
10:	   x = ((x - y) - (y - ((x + y) - ((y - x) + (x - y)))));
11:	   u = (x == y);
12:	   v = (10 != x);
13:	   v = (x != ((1 - y) + x));
14:	   v = (v == (u != ((78973 - y) == x)));
1:	 } EOF


Here is an analysis of identifier declarations and uses for tests/binary.csx:
2:	x(int): 6,8(2),9,10(5),11,12,13(2),14
3:	y(int): 7,9,10(5),11,13,14
4:	u(bool): 11,14
5:	v(bool): 12,13,14(2)
