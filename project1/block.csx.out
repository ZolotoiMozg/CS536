CSX program parsed correctly.
Here is its unparsing:
1:	 {
2:	   int a;
3:	   int b;
4:	   a = 0;
5:	   b = ((a + a) + 1);
6:	   if ((b != 0))
6:	      {
7:	         int c;
8:	         c = (a - b);
6:	      }
1:	 } EOF


Here is an analysis of identifier declarations and uses for tests/block.csx:
2:	a(int): 4,5(2),8
3:	b(int): 5,6,8
7:	c(int): 8
