CSX program parsed correctly.
Here is its unparsing:
1:	 {
2:	   int x;
3:	   int y;
4:	   x = 0;
5:	   y = (x + 10);
6:	   if ((x == 0))
7:	      {
8:	         int x;
9:	         int y;
10:	         x = 10;
11:	         y = (10 - x);
7:	      }
13:	   y = (x - y);
14:	   x = y;
1:	 } EOF


Here is an analysis of identifier declarations and uses for tests/hide.csx:
2:	x(int): 4,5,6,13,14
3:	y(int): 5,13(2),14
8:	x(int): 10,11
9:	y(int): 11
