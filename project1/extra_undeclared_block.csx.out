CSX program parsed correctly.
Here is its unparsing:
1:	 {
2:	   if ((a != 0))
2:	      {
3:	         int a;
4:	         a = 10;
5:	         a = (a - 5);
6:	         if ((a != 0))
6:	            {
7:	               a = (298 + a);
6:	            }
2:	      }
1:	 } EOF


Here is an analysis of identifier declarations and uses for tests/extra_undeclared_block.csx:
3:	a(int): 4,5(2),6,7(2)

Undeclared Identifiers:
	a(undeclared): 2
